2.  Lossy compression uses approximations to compress the data, ultimately
    discarding some data and lowering quality. Lossless compression uses
    algorithms to compress the data, but are reversible so one can retrieve the
    original quality from the compressed file.

4.  The data that points to the file's actual data is altered and declared to be
    free, but the file's actual data is not tampered with at all.
5.  One can overwrite the new data: this is often done by filling the actual
    data with zeros (NULL) or random characters.
6.  The header file for the library that constructed the data types int8_t,
    uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, uint32_t, int64_t, and uint64_t
7.  They are more specific types of integers and allow you to give more definit-
    ion to how they will be used, and allow you to use space efficiently.

10. biSize is the number of bytes needed by the info header, bfSize is the numb-
    er of bytes needed for the entire BMP file.
11. The vertical direction of the image will project upwards rather than down.
12. biBitCount
13. If the computer does not have enough memory or the proper permissions to
    open the file, it will return NULL.
14. We always read and work with a single element/block/pixel at a time.

16. fseek shifts the position that the computer is currently reading/writing at.
17. SEEK_CUR means "seek current," indicating that the fseek shift should be re-
    lative to the current position the file is being read from.
